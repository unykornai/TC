## SECTION 5: ONGOING MONITORING (The Differentiator)

### 5.1 Independent Verification Infrastructure

**Lender does not need to trust Borrower reporting.**

| Capability | Description | How Lender Verifies |
|:-----------|:------------|:--------------------|
| XRPL Attestations | Weekly on-chain snapshots with document hashes | Query public XRPL ledger |
| Capacity Calculation | Reproducible formula (Face × Haircut × Rate) | Excel tool provided |
| Document Hash Verification | SHA-256 hashes of all legal docs | Compute locally, compare to on-chain |
| Covenant Monitoring | Automated breach detection | Alerts via XRPL memo |

### 5.2 Reporting Cadence

| Report | Frequency | Delivery Method |
|:-------|:----------|:----------------|
| Borrowing Base Certificate | Monthly | PDF + snapshot bundle |
| XRPL Attestation | Weekly | On-chain (tx hash provided) |
| Collateral Valuation | Monthly | Snapshot bundle |
| Covenant Compliance | Monthly | BBC + exception log |
| Annual Audit | Yearly | CPA opinion |

### 5.3 Audit Runbook (Attached)

Lender receives step-by-step instructions to independently verify:
1. Snapshot hash matches on-chain attestation
2. Ed25519 signatures meet quorum (2-of-3)
3. Document hashes match referenced PDFs
4. Capacity calculation is accurate

**Time to verify:** ~10 minutes per snapshot  
**Dependencies:** None (no API access, no permissions required)

## SECTION 6: LEGAL POSTURE (Critical for Lender Comfort)

### 6.1 What XRPL Is and Is Not

| XRPL IS | XRPL IS NOT |
|:--------|:------------|
| Evidence layer | Custody system |
| Audit trail | Settlement mechanism |
| Monitoring infrastructure | Securities issuance platform |
| Optional verification tool | Required for enforcement |

### 6.2 Enforcement Path

If Borrower defaults:
1. **Traditional enforcement** — UCC foreclosure, account control
2. **Transfer agent action** — STC transfers collateral per Security Agreement
3. **XRPL role** — Provides evidence trail (optional, not required)

### 6.3 Failure Mode Statement

> "The XRPL evidence layer is provided for lender convenience and transparency. Failure of the XRPL system, network, or attestation process does not affect the validity, enforceability, or perfection of the security interest. All enforcement rights exist independently of the XRPL system."
