### 🔴 PENDING — The One Gating Item

## STC Holder Position Statement Confirming OPTKAS1

**What it is:** A statement from Securities Transfer Corporation confirming:

> OPTKAS1 is the holder of record (or controlling beneficial holder) of the TC Advantage Notes.

**Why it matters:** This is the single document that converts "this looks real" into "this is enforceable." Without it, lenders will:

- Review the package ✔
- Soft-approve the structure ✔
- Issue conditional terms ✔
- **But will NOT fund** ✘

**This is normal.** Not a red flag. Just a sequencing reality.

**What changes when it arrives:**

| Before STC Confirmation | After STC Confirmation |
|---|---|
| "Is this real?" | "What are the terms?" |
| Conditional interest | Binding term sheet negotiations |
| Diligence questions | Credit committee vote |
| Wait-and-see posture | Funding timeline discussions |

## What Lenders Will Ask (And Our Answers)

### Q: "Can you prove holder position?"
**A:** "STC confirmation is in process. We can provide you with all supporting documentation immediately, and the position statement upon issuance. We expect this within [X] business days."

### Q: "Why hasn't it been issued yet?"
**A:** "Standard STC processing timeline. The notes are verified, custody is confirmed, and chain of custody is complete. The position statement is the final administrative step."

### Q: "Can we proceed to diligence before it arrives?"
**A:** "Absolutely. The full data room is available. The position statement will be added upon receipt. We encourage parallel diligence."

## Risk Assessment (What Credit Committees Will Scrutinize)

### Low Risk
- Collateral quality (investment-grade notes at recognized TA)
- Enforcement mechanics (standard UCC framework)
- Documentation completeness (comprehensive)
- Presentation quality (institutional)

### Medium Risk
- Platform operational dependency (mitigated by traditional enforcement)
- Digital verification layer novelty (supplementary, not primary)
- SPV single-asset concentration (standard for this structure)

### Items That Are NOT Risks (But May Be Perceived As Such)
- XRPL attestation → **Supplementary verification, NOT custody**
- Blockchain involvement → **Delivery integrity only, NOT settlement**
- Smart contract references → **Future state, NOT current dependency**

---

## Recommended Sequence After STC Confirmation

1. **Immediately:** Update data room with position statement
2. **Same day:** Re-attest on XRPL with updated document hash
3. **Next business day:** Send follow-up to any lenders in active diligence
4. **Within 48 hours:** Push for term sheet / LOI commitments
5. **Within 1 week:** Target credit committee presentation at lead lender

---

## Bottom Line

> **Yes, this is truly fundable once holder confirmation is issued.**  
> **No, you do not need more documents.**  
> **Yes, your structure is conservative, clean, and enforceable.**

The package is credit-committee ready. The only variable is timing on the STC position statement.
