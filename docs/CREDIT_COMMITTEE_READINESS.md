## Risk Assessment (What Credit Committees Will Scrutinize)

### Low Risk
- Collateral quality (investment-grade notes at recognized TA)
- Enforcement mechanics (standard UCC framework)
- Documentation completeness (comprehensive)
- Presentation quality (institutional)

### Medium Risk
- Platform operational dependency (mitigated by traditional enforcement)
- Digital verification layer novelty (supplementary, not primary)
- SPV single-asset concentration (standard for this structure)

### Items That Are NOT Risks (But May Be Perceived As Such)
- XRPL attestation → **Supplementary verification, NOT custody**
- Blockchain involvement → **Delivery integrity only, NOT settlement**
- Smart contract references → **Future state, NOT current dependency**
