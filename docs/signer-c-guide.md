# Multisig Signer C — Selection Guide

**Purpose:** Governance candidate analysis for neutral third signer  
**Date:** February 2, 2026

## 🎯 WHAT SIGNER C MUST BE

A neutral control signer whose presence:

- ✅ Satisfies lender governance expectations
- ✅ Passes legal independence tests
- ✅ Does **not** create economic or control conflicts
- ✅ Can credibly testify to process integrity if required

**Signer C is not about speed. It's about trust and defensibility.**

---

## 🥇 OPTION 1: DEAL COUNSEL (RECOMMENDED)

**Role:** Independent legal counsel to OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV

### Why This is the Gold Standard

- ✔ **Fiduciary duty already defined**
- ✔ **No economic participation**
- ✔ **Independence easily defensible**
- ✔ **Familiar to lenders and auditors**
- ✔ **Clean explanation in credit committee memo**

### Lender Perception

> "This is exactly what we expect to see."

### Recommendation

**If available, choose this immediately.**  
This ends governance questions before they start.

## 🥈 OPTION 2: INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

**Role:** Non-economic, non-affiliate director/manager

### Pros

- ✔ Structurally neutral
- ✔ Can be documented cleanly
- ✔ Acceptable to most private credit funds

### Cons

- ⚠ Requires formal appointment documentation
- ⚠ Background diligence may be requested
- ⚠ Slightly slower than counsel option

### Recommendation

**Strong fallback if counsel declines.**

## 🥉 OPTION 3: LENDER REPRESENTATIVE

**Role:** Representative of eventual lender

### Cons (Material)

- ❌ Cannot be designated pre-lender
- ❌ Creates timing dependency
- ❌ May require amendment later
- ❌ Reduces control optionality

### Recommendation

**Do not use as initial Signer C.**  
Only viable post-close.

## 🚫 RED FLAGS (AVOID)

- ❌ Affiliate of Unykorn
- ❌ Affiliate of OPTKAS1 sponsor
- ❌ Anyone with success-based compensation
- ❌ Custodians or asset holders
- ❌ "Trusted friend" or informal advisor

**Lender response:** Immediate governance concern

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

> Signer C should be designated as independent deal counsel to OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV, acting solely in a non-custodial governance capacity for multisig authorization. This provides lender-standard neutrality, avoids economic conflicts, and satisfies audit and credit-committee expectations without introducing timing or amendment risk.
