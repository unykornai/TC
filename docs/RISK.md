## Risk Categories

### 1. Credit Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Borrower default | Medium | High | Collateral coverage ≥ 125%; independent valuation; trustee oversight |
| Collateral value decline | Medium | High | LTV monitoring; margin call triggers at 80% LTV; forced liquidation at 90% LTV |
| Counterparty failure (custodian) | Low | Critical | Tier 1 custodian selection; SIPC/FDIC coverage; backup custodian designated |
| Interest rate movement | Medium | Medium | Fixed-rate bonds; hedging available through regulated instruments |

### 2. Operational Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Automation failure | Low | Medium | Automation prepares only — cannot execute without signer; manual fallback documented |
| Key compromise | Very Low | Critical | HSM storage; multi-signature; signer rotation protocol; emergency pause |
| Smart contract/IOU logic error | Low | High | Dry-run mandatory; testnet validation; code audit; gradual rollout |
| Data integrity failure | Very Low | High | Hash attestation on public ledgers; 7-year audit retention |

### 3. Regulatory Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Securities classification of IOUs | Medium | High | IOUs are claim receipts, not securities; legal opinion obtained; structuring reviewed by counsel |

| Cross-border compliance | Medium | Medium | Stellar SEP-31 for cross-border; jurisdiction-specific compliance checks |
| Data privacy (GDPR/CCPA) | Low | Medium | No PII on ledger; dedicated PII store with encryption and access controls |

### 4. Technology Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| XRPL network disruption | Very Low | Low | XRPL provides evidence, not custody; operations continue off-chain |
| Stellar network disruption | Very Low | Low | Same as XRPL — evidence layer, not custody |
| HSM/KMS outage | Very Low | Medium | Multi-region deployment; manual signing fallback |
| Dependency vulnerability | Low | Medium | Minimal dependency policy; lockfiles; automated vulnerability scanning |

### 5. Liquidity Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insufficient secondary market for IOUs | High | Low | IOUs are claim receipts; primary redemption through bond indenture; DEX/AMM provides optional liquidity |

## Risk Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

The platform continuously monitors:

| Metric | Source | Alert Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Collateral LTV ratio | Custodian API / Oracle | > 80% | Margin call notification to Treasury + Trustee |
| Collateral LTV ratio | Custodian API / Oracle | > 90% | Emergency liquidation preparation |
| Escrow balance vs. outstanding IOUs | XRPL queries | Discrepancy > 0.01% | Reconciliation alert to Compliance |
| Failed attestations | Audit system | Any failure | Retry + alert to Compliance |
| Signer availability | HSM health checks | Any signer unreachable | Alert to all signers |
| Trading risk limits | Trading engine | Any limit breach | Auto-halt trading + alert to Treasury |

### Manual Reviews

| Review | Frequency | Performed By |
|---|---|---|
| Collateral valuation | Quarterly | Independent appraiser |
| Custody audit | Annual | External auditor (Big Four) |
| Governance review | Semi-annual | Trustee + legal counsel |
| Penetration test | Annual | Independent security firm |
