# FUNDER ARCHETYPE MAP

**Track:** 1 (Bond / Collateral Facility)  
**Purpose:** Internal reference — who funds this structure and why  
**Classification:** INTERNAL — NOT for lender distribution

---

## Core Thesis

This is a **collateralized credit facility** secured by **verified medium-term notes** held at a recognized transfer agent (STC), with UCC perfection and control agreements.

Funders lend **against the bonds**, not because they "like the story."

This is NOT:
- An equity raise
- A venture financing
- A platform investment
- A crypto deal

This IS:
- Monetizing verified collateral
- Senior secured facility
- Bond-backed lending
- Traditional enforcement with enhanced verification

---

## ✅ YES — These Groups Fund This Structure

### 1. Credit Funds Doing Bond-Backed Lending

**Why they fit:**
- Underwrite documents, custody, and enforceability
- Comfortable with UCC + transfer agent control
- Do not require issuer relationship equity
- See deals like this weekly

**What they look for:**
- Collateral verification (STC ✔)
- Chain of custody (Physical ✔)
- Borrowing base math (Defined ✔)
- Enforcement path (UCC ✔)
- Conservative LTV (20–40% ✔)

**Example firms:** Ares, Apollo, KKR, HPS, Fortress, Oaktree, Benefit Street, Cerberus, BlueMountain/Assured IM, Stonebriar

---

### 2. Structured Credit Desks (Family Office + Institutional Hybrids)

**Why they fit:**
- Like conservative LTV
- Like visible custody (STC)
- Like enforcement clarity
- Often faster than banks, quieter than funds

**What they look for:**
- Clean documentation
- Transparent collateral position
- Professional presentation
- No hype, no promotion

**Regions:** Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh), Swiss, Singapore, US multi-family offices with lending mandates

---

### 3. SBLC / MT760 Desks That Warehouse Notes

**Why they fit:**
- MT760 familiarity
- Short diligence cycles
- Will price conservatively but move fast
- Comfortable with Path A (direct monetization) and Path C (SBLC enhancement)

**What they look for:**
- Instrument legitimacy
- Custody confirmation
- Transfer mechanics
- Settlement infrastructure

**Access via:** Credit Suisse legacy desks (now family office vehicles), Deutsche Bank–linked SBLC desks (non-bank conduits), Standard Chartered trade finance partners, Barclays-adjacent private credit desks

---

### 4. Private Credit Funds That Underwrite Collateral First

**Why they fit:**
- Asset-based finance is their explicit mandate
- Borrowing base + reporting is native to their process
- Understand STC, UCC, haircut math
- Do not fear 144A notes

**What they look for:**
- Advance rate justification
- Automated reporting capability
- Covenant discipline
- Exception reporting

**Example firms:** White Oak, Gordon Brothers, Blue Owl (ABF desk), Neuberger Berman (private credit), Guggenheim (ABF/portfolio strategy)

---

### 5. Bank-Adjacent Non-Bank Lenders

**Why they fit:**
- Regulated infrastructure without bank timelines
- Specialty finance focus
- Comfortable with structured paper
- Faster decisioning than banks

**What they look for:**
- Institutional-grade documentation
- Clear regulatory posture
- Traditional enforcement preserved
- No blockchain dependency

---

### 6. Structured Note Warehousing Groups (Backstop)

**Why they fit:**
- Lend smaller first, then scale
- Like Reg S / 144A paper
- Repo-style lending for medium-term notes
- Warehouse capacity

**Entry point:** After a soft term sheet exists from a Tier 1 lender

---

### 7. Insurance-Wrapped Credit Syndicates (Backstop)

**Why they fit — specifically for OPTKAS:**
- C.J. Coleman wrapper exists
- FCA-regulated broker trail exists
- Premium invoices on file

This gives **downside narrative**, not upside hype. These syndicates fund the insurance-backed credit position, not the platform.

---

## ❌ NO — These Groups Will NOT Fund This

| Category | Why Not |
|---|---|
| **Venture Capital** | Wrong product. Looking for equity, not secured lending. Will try to reframe deal. |
| **Private Equity Growth Funds** | Wrong timeline, wrong incentives. Need equity upside, not yield. |
| **Insurance Company General Accounts** | Too slow for this ticket size. Internal policies kill momentum. |
| **Retail Bond Buyers** | No infrastructure. Cannot diligence. Cannot enforce. |
| **Crypto-Native Funds** | Wrong mandate. Don't do secured lending properly. Will confuse market. |
| **Traditional Banks** | Too slow. Rigid internal crypto/DLT policies. Committee timelines incompatible. |
| **Family Offices (Direct, No Credit Arm)** | Too idiosyncratic. Endless questions. No underwriting discipline. |

## Key Principle

> **We are not raising equity. We are monetizing verified collateral.**

Every funder interaction must start from this sentence. If a funder asks about equity, platform upside, or token economics — they are in the wrong lane. Politely redirect or exit.
