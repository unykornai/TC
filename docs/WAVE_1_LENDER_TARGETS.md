## Email Routing Logic

**Subject line (always):**
> Senior Secured Facility | Collateral Verified | Borrowing Base + Reporting Ready | XRPL-Attested Delivery

**Structure (every email):**
1. First sentence: advance rate ask + collateral type + custody/control status
2. Second sentence: borrowing base + reporting covenant cadence
3. Third sentence: XRPL TX hash (proof of delivery integrity)
4. Ask: term sheet / LOI

---

## Outreach Cadence

- **Wave 1:** Firms 1–7 (best fit, highest probability)
- **Wave 2:** Firms 8–10 + expanded list (10–20 additional)
- **Diligence calls:** Scheduled within 48 hours of data room opens

## DO NOT APPROACH

| Category | Reason |
|---|---|
| Traditional banks | Too slow, rigid, internal crypto policies kill momentum |
| Crypto / Web3 funds | Don't do secured lending properly, will try to reframe deal |
| Venture / equity investors | Wrong product, wrong timeline, wrong incentives |
| Family offices (direct) | Too idiosyncratic, endless questions, no underwriting discipline |

*This list is Track 1 only. Track 2 (Sponsor) targets are a separate, later exercise.*
