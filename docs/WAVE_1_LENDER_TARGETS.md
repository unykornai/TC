## Backstop — Second-Wave / Redundancy

Approach **after** a soft term sheet exists from a Tier 1/1B lender.

### Structured Note Warehousing Groups
- Lend smaller first, then scale
- Warehouse lenders tied to broker-dealers
- Structured note desks that like Reg S / 144A paper
- Repo-style lenders for medium-term notes

### Insurance-Wrapped Credit Syndicates
- Leverage existing C.J. Coleman wrapper
- FCA-regulated broker trail on file
- Premium invoices documented
- Provides **downside narrative**, not upside hype

---

## Email Routing Logic

**Subject line (always):**
> Senior Secured Facility | Collateral Verified | Borrowing Base + Reporting Ready | XRPL-Attested Delivery

**Structure (every email):**
1. First sentence: advance rate ask + collateral type + custody/control status
2. Second sentence: borrowing base + reporting covenant cadence
3. Third sentence: XRPL TX hash (proof of delivery integrity)
4. Ask: term sheet / LOI

---

## Outreach Cadence

- **Monday (Wave 1):** Tier 1A firms 1–10 (bond-backed credit funds)
- **Monday (Wave 1B):** Tier 1B firms 11–14 (SBLC / MT760 desks) — if relationships exist
- **Wave 2 (after first responses):** Tier 2A/2B firms 15–20 + Tier 3 firms 21–23
- **Backstop (after soft term sheet):** Warehouse + insurance-wrapped groups
- **Diligence calls:** Scheduled within 48 hours of data room opens

## DO NOT APPROACH

| Category | Reason |
|---|---|
| Traditional banks | Too slow, rigid, internal DLT policies kill momentum |
| Crypto / Web3 funds | Don't do secured lending properly, will try to reframe deal |
| Venture / equity investors | Wrong product, wrong timeline, wrong incentives |
| Family offices (no credit arm) | Too idiosyncratic, endless questions, no underwriting discipline |
| Insurance company general accounts | Too slow for this ticket size, wrong internal mandate |
| Retail bond buyers | No infrastructure, cannot diligence, cannot enforce |
| PE growth funds | Looking for equity upside, not yield |
