# LANE DISCIPLINE RULEBOOK — INTERNAL

**Owner:** OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV  
**Status:** ACTIVE — effective immediately  
**Classification:** Internal only — do NOT share with funders

---

## Two-Lane Rule

All capital-raising activity must operate in **two separate lanes**.
Mixing them causes confusion, delays, and lost leverage.

### Lane A — Bond / Collateral Facility (Track 1)

**Goal:** Get the bond funded / facility closed.

We **DO**:
- Talk collateral, custody, borrowing base, reporting, enforcement
- Use the XRPL TX hash as proof of delivery integrity
- Invite LOI / term sheet
- Share the read-only data room
- Reference the platform as verification infrastructure

We **DO NOT**:
- Pitch sponsor economics
- Share Sponsor Consideration Note with bond lenders
- Negotiate platform licensing during collateral underwriting
- Attach PDFs to emails
- Discuss IP ownership, platform revenue, or utilization fees

### Lane B — Sponsor / Platform (Track 2)

**Goal:** Protect sponsor rights + optional separate monetization later.

We **DO**:
- Keep internal sponsor docs executed and current
- Reference their existence to bond lenders in one sentence only
- Prepare a separate data room for Track 2 when ready

We **DO NOT**:
- Include sponsor docs in the Track 1 data room
- Ask Track 1 lenders to review sponsor economics
- Combine both tracks in the same email or call

---

## The One Sentence (If Asked About Sponsor/Operator)

If a Track 1 lender asks about sponsor/operator arrangements, use this **exact** response:

> "The platform is operated under executed sponsor/operator agreements; the sponsor economics are separate from the borrowing base and do not encumber collateral."

Then stop. Do not elaborate. Do not offer to share documents.

---

## Lane Violation Consequences

If someone breaks the lane rule:

1. Lender confusion → delays diligence by 1-2 weeks minimum
2. "Who pays for the platform?" question → derails underwriting
3. Funders assume someone else is responsible → you lose leverage
4. Internal economics leak → weakens future negotiating position

---

## Enforcement

- Every outreach email must be reviewed for lane compliance before sending
- Every call deck / agenda must identify which track it serves
- No document crosses lanes without explicit approval

---

## Summary

| | Track 1 (Bond) | Track 2 (Sponsor) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who funds** | ABL / credit funds | Sponsor-finance / fintech / family offices |
| **What they fund** | Bond / collateral facility | Sponsor Note / platform economics |
| **What they see** | Data room, collateral, borrowing base | Sponsor Note, estoppel, platform metrics |
| **What they don't see** | Sponsor economics | Bond collateral details |
| **Paper** | Credit agreement, UCC, control | Sponsor Note, assignment rights |
| **Timing** | NOW | After Track 1 closes (or quietly in parallel) |
