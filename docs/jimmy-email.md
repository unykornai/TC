**Priority:** High

## EMAIL BODY

Hi Jimmy,

The TC Advantage facility infrastructure is complete and ready for partner agreement execution.

**You have one decision to make, then sign.**

---

### 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (15 minutes)

**Quick Start Guide:**  
[Quick Start Execution](execution-quick-start.md)

**Three steps:**

1. **Choose economic option** (Option A or Option B)
2. **Sign signature page** (DocuSign or wet signature)
3. **Send signed PDF back**

That's it. The technical team handles IPFS/XRPL attestation.

---

### 🎯 ECONOMIC OPTIONS (Pick One)

**Option A: Net Cash Flow Participation** (Recommended)
- 10% of Net Distributable Cash Flow
- Paid per distribution event
- No upfront fee

**Option B: Hybrid Model**
- 2% success fee (at facility close)
- 4% of Net Distributable Cash Flow (ongoing)

**We need to agree on the same option before signing.**

I recommend **Option A** — simpler structure, no upfront payment, aligns incentives long-term.

Let me know which you prefer by **February 5, 2026**.

### 📄 DOCUMENTS TO REVIEW (Optional)

Full agreement package:  
[Partner Issuance Package](partner-issuance.md)

- Strategic Infrastructure & Execution Agreement
- Exhibit A: Economic Participation
- Exhibit B: Smart Contract Settlement Spec

**You don't have to read the technical specs** — your counsel can review if needed.
