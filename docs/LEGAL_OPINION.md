3. **Enforceability:** The Loan Documents are legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms.

4. **No Conflicts:** The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents do not conflict with the Borrower's Operating Agreement or applicable law.

5. **UCC Perfection:** The security interest in the pledged securities has been properly perfected under Article 8 and 9 of the Wyoming Uniform Commercial Code.

This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Wyoming.
