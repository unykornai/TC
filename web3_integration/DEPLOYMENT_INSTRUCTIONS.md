## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Option 1: Deploy Immediately (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install xrpl-py requests

# Configure for mainnet
python unykorn_xrpl_bridge.py --mode production

# Generate first institutional POFs
python -c "
from unykorn_xrpl_bridge import UnyKornXRPLBridge
import asyncio

async def deploy():
    bridge = UnyKornXRPLBridge('mainnet')
    
    # Generate POFs for immediate deployment
    blackstone_pof = await bridge.generate_institutional_pof('Blackstone Credit', 350000000)
    apollo_pof = await bridge.generate_institutional_pof('Apollo Global', 300000000)
    
    # Output institutional reports
    with open('BLACKSTONE_POF.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write(bridge.format_pof_report(blackstone_pof))
    
    with open('APOLLO_POF.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write(bridge.format_pof_report(apollo_pof))
    
    print('✅ Ready for mega-institutional deployment!')

asyncio.run(deploy())
"
```

### **Option 2: Add More Features First**
If you want to expand before deployment (NOT recommended given funding urgency):
- Add liquidity pools (requires ~1000 XRP)
- Build comprehensive DEX integration  
- Create automated market maker

**⚠️ WARNING:** This delays access to $300M-600M+ funding opportunity
