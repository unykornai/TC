## 1. FUNDING STRATEGY ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 Core Strategy Framework

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|:----------|:--------------|:----------|
| **Facility Structure** | Single-asset SPV-backed credit facility | Institutional standard, clean bankruptcy remoteness |
| **Collateral** | $10M TC Advantage 5% MTN (CUSIP 87225HAB4) | Investment-grade, rated security with established trading history |
| **Advance Rate** | 40% target, 50% acceptable haircut | Conservative valuation with institutional acceptance buffer |

| **Pricing** | SOFR + 8-12% | Institutional market rates for secured financing |
| **Covenants** | Standard institutional (no equity cures, clean defaults) | Platform requirements for automated processing |

### 1.2 Economic Participation (Option B)
- **Success Fee:** 2% of funded amount ($80K on $4M facility)
- **Ongoing Participation:** 4% of net cash flows
- **Payment Trigger:** Funding close for success fee, distribution events for participation
- **Settlement:** XRPL primary, wire transfer fallback

### 1.3 Risk Management Framework

| Risk Category | Mitigation Strategy | Impact Assessment |

| **Collateral Valuation** | Accept 50% haircut if required | Reduces facility size but increases institutional acceptance |
| **Platform Rejection** | 15+ simultaneous submissions | Statistical coverage across platforms |
| **Timing Delays** | 45-day execution window | Allows for due diligence and approval processes |
| **Market Conditions** | Flexible pricing (SOFR + 8-15%) | Accommodates varying market environments |
