# SIGNER C OUTREACH PACKAGE

**Independent Governance Signer – Limited Scope**

---

## 1. COVER EMAIL (PRIMARY VERSION – CONSERVATIVE)

**Subject:** Limited-Scope Governance Role Request – Non-Custodial Multisig Authorization (OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV)

Dear [Counsel Name],

I am writing regarding a narrowly defined governance role in connection with the OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV secured notes financing infrastructure.

The transaction documentation and operational framework are complete and execution-ready. As part of standard institutional control design, the SPV is implementing a **2-of-3 authorization model** for settlement execution, requiring two independent approvals for any payment or distribution event.

We are seeking to designate **independent deal counsel** as the third authorizing signer ("Signer C"), acting **solely in a non-custodial, governance-only capacity**.

This role is intentionally limited and designed to align with lender, audit, and risk-committee expectations.

### Scope (Signer C)

* Independent authorization signer within a **2-of-3** approval framework
* Governance confirmation that defined execution conditions are met
* Execution via cryptographic signature only (no custody, no control of assets)
* Completion of a short signer attestation confirming role and address control

### Explicit Exclusions

* No custody of funds or securities
* No asset management or discretionary authority
* No monitoring, supervision, or ongoing operational oversight
* No broker-dealer, investment adviser, or fiduciary role

This structure is consistent with institutional transaction controls and is intended to provide independence and audit defensibility without imposing operational responsibility.

If you are open to reviewing this role, I can provide:

* A one-page role summary
* The signer attestation document
* The multisig configuration (role-defined, non-custodial)

If appropriate, this can be documented under a limited-scope engagement letter with customary liability limitations.

Please let me know if you would be willing to review this request, or if a brief call would be helpful.

Sincerely,  
**[Your Name]**  
**[Your Title]**  
Unykorn 7777, Inc.

## 3. EXPECTED Q&A (PRE-EMPTIVE)

**Q: Does this create custody or asset control risk?**  
A: No. Signer C cannot execute unilaterally and never holds assets.

**Q: Is this an ongoing monitoring obligation?**  
A: No. Signer C acts only upon specific authorization requests.

**Q: How frequently would signatures be requested?**  
A: Infrequent and event-driven (initial settlement events and scheduled distributions).

**Q: What if a key is lost or rotated?**  
A: Address rotation procedures are defined and require superseding attestations.

**Q: Is compensation expected?**  
A: To be agreed if required; the role is governance-based, not performance-based.

**Q: Does this expose the firm to transaction risk?**  
A: No commercial or investment discretion is granted; role is limited to authorization confirmation.
