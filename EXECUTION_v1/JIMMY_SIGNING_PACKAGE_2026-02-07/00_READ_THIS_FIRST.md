# SIGNING PACKAGE — OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV

**To:** Jimmy  
**From:** Kevan — Unykorn 7777, Inc.  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Re:** Execution of Partner Infrastructure Agreements

---

## What This Is

This package contains **5 documents** that formalize the infrastructure and execution agreement between OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV and Unykorn 7777, Inc.

These lock in:
- Your system was built and delivered
- Your compensation structure is defined
- Your IP is protected
- The SPV is papered properly before any lender sees it

**These are internal / sponsor-side documents. They do NOT go to lenders.**

---

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1 — Choose Option A or Option B (1 minute)

In **Document 02** (Exhibit A), you must elect ONE:

| Option | Structure |
|---|---|
| **Option A** (Recommended) | 10% of Net Distributable Cash Flow per distribution event |
| **Option B** | 2% success fee at facility close + 4% ongoing participation |

**Both of us must choose the same option.** I recommend Option A.

### Step 2 — Sign 5 Documents (5 minutes)

Sign each document where it says **OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV / Manager**.

**How to sign** (any of these work):
- Print → sign in ink → scan to PDF
- Open in Adobe Acrobat → digital signature → save as PDF
- Open in Preview (Mac) → sign → save as PDF

### Step 3 — Send Back (1 minute)

Return all 5 signed PDFs to me via email or secure transfer.

**That's it. I handle everything else** (hashing, IPFS, XRPL attestation).
