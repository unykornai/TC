### YOUR 3 STEPS

**Step 1 — Pick Option A or Option B**

- **Option A** (I recommend this): 10% of net cash flow per distribution
- **Option B**: 2% upfront + 4% ongoing

Reply to this email with your choice. We both need to pick the same one.

**Step 2 — Sign 5 documents**

Click each link below. Print it, sign where it says "OPTKAS1-MAIN SPV / Manager", scan to PDF.

1. **Infrastructure Agreement** — https://github.com/unykornai/TC/blob/main/EXECUTION_v1/JIMMY_SIGNING_PACKAGE_2026-02-07/01_Strategic_Infrastructure_Agreement.md

2. **Economic Election (Exhibit A)** — https://github.com/unykornai/TC/blob/main/EXECUTION_v1/JIMMY_SIGNING_PACKAGE_2026-02-07/02_Exhibit_A_Economic_Participation.md

3. **Signature Page** — https://github.com/unykornai/TC/blob/main/EXECUTION_v1/JIMMY_SIGNING_PACKAGE_2026-02-07/03_Signature_Page.md

4. **Sponsor Note** — https://github.com/unykornai/TC/blob/main/EXECUTION_v1/JIMMY_SIGNING_PACKAGE_2026-02-07/04_Sponsor_Consideration_Note.md

5. **Estoppel Certificate** — https://github.com/unykornai/TC/blob/main/EXECUTION_v1/JIMMY_SIGNING_PACKAGE_2026-02-07/05_Sponsor_Note_Estoppel.md

**Step 3 — Send back**

Email me the 5 signed PDFs. I handle everything else (hashing, attestation, archive).

### WHAT THESE DO (30-second version)

- Locks in that the system was built and delivered ✔
- Defines your compensation structure ✔
- Protects the IP ✔
- Papers the SPV properly before lenders see it ✔

These are internal documents between us. They do NOT go to lenders.

---

### TIMELINE

- You sign and return: **today**
- I do the crypto attestation: **Sunday**
- Lender outreach begins: **Monday**

If you want to do this fast: reply "Option A", print all 5, sign, scan, send. Done.

Call me if you have any questions.

Best,
