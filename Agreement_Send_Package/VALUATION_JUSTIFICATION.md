|:----------|:------|
| **Monthly License Fee** | $20,000/month per SPV |
| **Platform Utilization Fee** | 10% of transaction amount |

## 5. RISK-ADJUSTED VALUATION

| Scenario | Platform Value | Note Principal | Coverage |
|:---------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------|
| **Downside** | $2,250,000 | $2,500,000 | 0.9x |
| **Base Case** | $3,500,000 | $2,500,000 | 1.4x |
| **Upside** | $5,500,000 | $2,500,000 | 2.2x |

In the base case, the platform value provides **1.4x coverage** of the Sponsor Note principal. Combined with the SPV's $10M collateral base, the note sits within a well-supported credit structure.

## 6. COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS

| Transaction | Platform Type | Build Cost | Funding Secured |
|:------------|:-------------|:-----------|:----------------|
| Securitize | Digital securities platform | $15M+ | $48M Series B |
| Centrifuge | RWA tokenization | $8M+ | $30M+ raised |
| Goldfinch | Credit protocol | $5M+ | $37M Series A |
| Maple Finance | Institutional lending | $10M+ | $36M raised |

These are equity comparisons. A $2.5M note against a $3.5M delivered platform is conservative by any measure.
